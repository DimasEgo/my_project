The file associated with this project contains meteorological data. The file is a text file consisting of a header (with '#' marking the start of each header line) followed by the data itself, in the form of comma-separated values ​​(CSV) with each line corresponding to a single day at a single station. Note that the days are not necessarily continuous: there may be gaps in the data, and different stations do not record the same days over the entire period covered by the data. The header includes information on the weather stations, each classified with a station (STN) number, coordinates and name, and the list of measured variables (given as uppercase letter codes) and their descriptions.
